This has been an ever evolving project that I still use with my friends in Discord today.
It contains a web UI where users can login with their Discord accounts and upload sound clips.
These sound clips can then be played in Discord by using the `#` command followed by the sound clip
name.

We have a lot of fun with this and I've added new features such as playing sound clips from the web
UI and the ability to clip the last minute of voice chat. The web UI also contains upload history and
various statistics about the Discord chat.
