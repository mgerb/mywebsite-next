This was a fun project inspired by a similar project that kept track of trending repos on Github.
It looks like this project is no longer around, but I continue to run this and it is updated daily.

I used [a python package](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud) to generate a word cloud for the top
trending subreddits each year.
