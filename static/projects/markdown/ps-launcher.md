World of Warcraft is a game I loved playing and at one point I was interested in private servers.
These servers were easy to connect to, but required some extra configuration. This was a fun
opportunity to play around with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) to build a desktop app that
manipulates game files and then launches the game.
