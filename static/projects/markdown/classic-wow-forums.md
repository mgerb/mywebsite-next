When I heard the announcement of Classic World of Warcraft I wanted to remake
the old forums as they were back in 2005. The front end is built with React
and I took this opportunity to learn Elixir for the back end. I was able to get
most of the actual assets from the old site on [The Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/).

The forum is fully functional and even connects to Blizzard servers to allow users to authenticate with OAuth.

I'm not sure how long I'm going to keep the site, but as of writing this it is still up https://classicwowforums.com.

### Here are some screenshots of the site in it's current state
