# React starter project with Typescript and Webpack 2

I recently switched over to Typescript and it's super nice! The combination with VSCode's IntelliSense is amazing! It was a bit tedious to set up at first, but it's worth it!

## react-starter

I tend to start on web projects quite often so I made a project that I can use to jump right into things! I recently updated it to use the latest Webpack version (2) as well as Typescript! I also pulled in the newest react-router, which is renamed to react-router-browser for browsers.

I played around with [Flow](https://flow.org/) a little bit, which is a static type checker for javascript, but I decided to go with Typescript. I think it has more momentum right now and it seems to have a bigger community. It also works great with React and React Native!

I plan to keep this project up to date with the latest web standards.

At the time of this post I currently am using the following:

- React
- Typescript
- Yarn
- Webpack 2
