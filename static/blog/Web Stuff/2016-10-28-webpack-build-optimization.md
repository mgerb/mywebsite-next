# Building for production with Webpack

I've been using webpack for almost 6 months now and I still only know a fraction of the tools it provides. Bundling my files for production has been a bit of an annoyance, but I'm at a point where everything works. View my current webpack configuration file at the bottom of the post.

## Production vs. Development

So the goal is to have two different build options for webpack: one for production and one for development. The development build needs to include things like source maps and logging while the production build needs JS minification. There are a few different ways to do this.

### Multiple webpack configuration files

Some choose to create a `webpack.prod.config.js` file, which could be useful for projects of massive scale. I found this option a bit tedious because I did not want to update two different configuration files when I found a new tool for webpack.

### NODE_ENV=production webpack -p

NODE_ENV is an environment variable that can be used within the code itself. I use one `webpack.config.js` file and enable certain plugins based on this condition. The environment variable can be passed to webpack with `NODE=<variable> webpack`. On Windows the command translates to the command below. For some reason Windows likes to add the space after production to the variable so that must be removed. There is a tool called [cross-env](https://github.com/kentcdodds/cross-env) that solves this issue, but I have not used it as I primarily develop on a unix system.

```bash
  set NODE_ENV=production&&webpack -p
```

I'm not going to discuss the specific plugins I use as they change quite often, but a few of the production plugins are below. More information about these can be found in the webpack documentation.

```javascript
    var debug = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';

    if (!debug){
        plugins = plugins.concat([
            new webpack.optimize.DedupePlugin(),
            new webpack.optimize.OccurenceOrderPlugin(),
            new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({ mangle: false, sourcemap: false})
      ])}
    }
```

This environment variable can be passed to the application this way by using the webpack environment plugin.

```javascript
new webpack.EnvironmentPlugin(["NODE_ENV"]);
```

`process.env.NODE_ENV` can then be checked for within the application itself. I currently use this to enable Redux logging for development.

```javascript
const debug = process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production";

//run redux logger if we are in dev mode
const middleware = debug
  ? applyMiddleware(thunk, logger())
  : applyMiddleware(thunk);
```

I was originally going to discuss build optimization here, but I think I will save that for another post. My JS bundle was almost 1mb and I got it down to a little less than 400kb.

## My current webpack configurations

Here is my webpack.config.js file at the time of writing this post. My current webpack config file can be found here. [webpack.config.js](https://github.com/mgerb/mywebsite/blob/master/webpack.config.js)

```javascript
var debug = process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production";
var webpack = require("webpack");
var path = require("path");
var HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
var autoprefixer = require("autoprefixer");
var Visualizer = require("webpack-visualizer-plugin");

module.exports = {
  devtool: debug ? "inline-sourcemap" : null,

};

function getPlugins() {
  var plugins = [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      fileName: "index.html",
      template: "index.html",
      inject: "body",
      hash: true,
    }),
    new webpack.EnvironmentPlugin(["NODE_ENV"]),
    new Visualizer({
      filename: "../stats.html",
    }),
  ];
  if (!debug) {
    plugins = plugins.concat([
      new webpack.optimize.DedupePlugin(),
      new webpack.optimize.OccurenceOrderPlugin(),
      new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({ mangle: false, sourcemap: false }),
    ]);
  }
  return plugins;
}
