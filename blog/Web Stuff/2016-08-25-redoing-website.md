# Redoing this website for the third time

New web technologies never cease to amaze me. Every time I learn a new technology used in the web my mind is blown. Shortly after this happens
I discover something newer that is just bigger and better. Because of this, I am always learning, which is awesome!

## It's been awhile

It has been quite a long time since I posted anything on this site. Since the last post I've graduated college and started a career as a software engineer.
I'm currently mainly working on front end development with AngularJS, which is pretty exciting! I previously used Angular on this site to help myself learn the framework.
Angular is pretty great, but I've found a new web framework that I'm absolutely loving so far! It's a framework developed by Facebook called [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

I've decided to completely redo this site again because I know I can do it better as I learn more and more. Credit for most of my design can be given to [Nikolay](http://nikolay.rocks).
I love the simple design that he has come up with on his site. Some of the site is open source, but I am redoing a lot of it to my liking;

The source code for this site can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/mgerb/mywebsite) (currently developing on the react branch);

Here are some of the core items that I'm using to develop this site:

- [Go](https://golang.org/)
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/)

There are many other tools here and there such as [MarkedJS](https://github.com/chjj/marked) and [HighlightJS](https://highlightjs.org/)
that I've also used in the process. I am excited to discuss my thoughts and experiences with many other technologies like this.
